# Surprise Housing Price Prediction 
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. Need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
> Building a linear regression model to predict the price of houses basis different features; identify the top predictors and how well they can predict the price

## General Information
- House Prices can depend on number of factors from size to neighbourhood, number of rooms to quality of kitchen, etc.
- Since Price is a continous variable, using regression model
- Selected top 30 predictors in identifying the price of the model
- Applied Regularization methods to prevent overfitting of the model

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Built a Linear Regularization model that can predict the variance in prices with around 87% accuracy
- Regression model with Lasso Regularization worked best for the use case
- Top 5 predictors in price prediction came out to be : ('GrLivArea', 'RoofMatl_CompShg', 'OverallQual', 'MSZoning_RL', 'RoofMatl_WdShngl')
- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
